        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I created this website using the HTML and CSS. I used HTMl to write the content of the website
            and CSS to format how that would look on your screen. I used a lot of CSS to edit things
            like the color, size, and style of almost all elements on this website. The text in the home page that 
            is organized into three sections is not three paragraph elements, but one table. By gettind rid of the border color
            it no longer looks like a table but instead like boxes of text. The 'A Closer Look' page alternates paragraph
            and image elements, with sources for the image included in each image element. This about page is simple,
            just a header and paragraph element.
            <br>
        The programs I used are VS Code to write the code and GitHub to publish the website. I also used the website
       <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">w3 schools</a> for HTML and CSS instructions on how to create elements 
       that we did not cover in class, such as tables and the menu bar. Finally, I used the website <a href="https://coolors.co/?home">coolors</a> 
       to help me come up with a color palette.</p>
